<p> I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do my best.
    i am a young man of highschool graduate who is also dedicated to learn programing as career. ilike people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence.
    I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I'm not comfortable with settling, and I'm always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.Since we are an increasingly technologically reliant society it 
    is also apparent that there will be jobs in the programming sector for a long time to come and decided to join the programing field.the maian reason why joined moringa shool is visualise real problem ,enhance problem solving skills and complenment my creativity.
